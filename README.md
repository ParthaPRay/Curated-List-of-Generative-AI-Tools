# Foundation Model

A foundation model is an AI model that is trained on broad and extensive datasets, allowing it to be applied across a wide range of use cases. These models have become instrumental in the field of artificial intelligence and have powered various applications, including chatbots and generative AI. The term "foundation model" was popularized by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). 

The term "foundation model," as coined by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) in August 2021, refers to a class of AI models that have been meticulously designed to be adaptable powerhouses in the realm of artificial intelligence. These models are characterized by their extensive training on diverse data using self-supervision at scale, making them versatile and capable of tackling a wide range of tasks. The term was chosen with great care to emphasize their intended function, which is to serve as the foundational building blocks for diverse AI applications. Unlike narrower terms like "large language model" or "self-supervised model," "foundation model" underscores their adaptability and applicability across various domains, thereby avoiding misconceptions about their capabilities and training methods. In essence, foundation models represent a groundbreaking approach to AI development, offering boundless potential for innovation and problem-solving across different fields and modalities.

Key points about foundation models:

* General-Purpose Technology: Foundation models are designed to be general-purpose technologies that can support a diverse range of applications. They are versatile and can be adapted to various tasks.

* Resource-Intensive Development: Building foundation models can be highly resource-intensive, with significant costs involved. Some of the most advanced models require substantial investments in data collection and computational power, often costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

* Examples Across Modalities: Foundation models are not limited to text-based applications. They have been developed for various modalities, including images (e.g., DALL-E and Flamingo), music (e.g., MusicGen), robotic control (e.g., RT-2), and more. This broadens their applicability.

* Diverse Fields of Application: Foundation models are being developed and applied in a wide range of fields, including astronomy, radiology, robotics, genomics, music composition, coding, mathematics, and others. They are seen as transformative in AI development across multiple domains.

* Definitions and Regulation: The term "foundation model" was coined by the CRFM, and various definitions have emerged as governments and regulatory bodies aim to provide legal frameworks for these models. In the U.S., a foundation model is defined as having broad data, self-supervision, and tens of billions of parameters. The European Union and the United Kingdom have their own definitions with some subtle distinctions.

* Personalization: Foundation models are not inherently capable of handling specific personal concepts. Methods have been developed to augment these models with personalized information or concepts without requiring a full retraining of the model. This personalization can be achieved for various tasks, such as image retrieval or text-to-image generation.

* Opportunities and Risks: Foundation models offer tremendous opportunities in various fields, including language processing, vision, robotics, and more. However, they also come with risks, including concerns about inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impacts, and ethical considerations. The widespread use of foundation models has raised questions about the concentration of economic and political power.

# Large-scale Language Models

Large-scale language models (LLMs) are distinguished by their comprehensive language comprehension and generation abilities. These models are trained on vast data sets, learning billions of parameters, and require significant computational power for both training and operation. Typically structured as artificial neural networks, predominantly transformers, LLMs are trained through self-supervised and semi-supervised learning methods.

Functioning as autoregressive language models, LLMs process input text and iteratively predict subsequent words or tokens. Until 2020, fine-tuning was the sole approach for tailoring these models to specific tasks. However, larger models like GPT-3 have demonstrated that prompt engineering can achieve comparable results. LLMs are believed to assimilate knowledge of syntax, semantics, and "ontology" from human language data, but they also inherit any inaccuracies and biases present in these data sources.

Prominent examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series (such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 used in ChatGPT), Google's PaLM (utilized in Bard), Meta's LLaMA, along with BLOOM, Ernie 3.0 Titan, and Anthropic's Claude 2.

We present the comparative list of LLMs below. Traning cost is presented as (petaFLOP/day). For the training cost column, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP/sec Ã— 1 day = 8.64E19 FLOP.

# Emerging LLM App Stack

The emerging tech stack for LLMs represents a rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and platforms that empower developers to build and deploy LLM-based applications. With the continuous growth and innovation in the LLM field, it's crucial to highlight the tooling available to complement these models.

One essential component in the LLM app stack is "Playgrounds." Playgrounds serve as user-friendly interfaces that allow developers to experiment with LLM-based applications. They provide an entry point for individuals to interact with LLMs, such as generating text based on prompts or transcribing audio files. These browser-based interfaces often come equipped with the necessary resources, such as GPU access, making them accessible for experimentation.

In terms of app hosting, developers have several options. Local hosting, while cost-effective during the development phase, is limited to individual use and may not scale well for production applications. Self-hosting offers more control over data privacy and application management but comes with significant GPU costs and quality considerations.

Emerging app hosting products like Vercel, Steamship, Streamlit, and Modal are simplifying the deployment of LLM applications. Vercel, for instance, streamlines front-end deployment, allowing developers to quickly deploy AI apps using pre-built templates. Steamship focuses on building AI agents powered by LLMs for problem-solving and automation. Streamlit, an open-source Python library, enables developers to create web front-ends for LLM projects without prior front-end experience. Modal abstracts complexities related to cloud deployment, improving the feedback loop between local development and cloud execution.

The common theme among these emerging tools is their ability to abstract complex technologies, allowing developers to focus on their code and applications. As the AI landscape evolves rapidly, these tools play a crucial role in reducing the time and effort required for building and deploying LLM applications, making them invaluable resources for developers in this dynamic field.

# Evaluating Models

Evaluating a generative AI model involves a multifaceted assessment that encompasses several critical aspects. Firstly, assessing the quality of the model involves scrutinizing the accuracy and relevance of its generated output. However, with the increasing complexity of these models, their behavior can sometimes become unpredictable, potentially leading to outputs that may not always be reliable. Secondly, evaluating the model's robustness is essential, focusing on its ability to handle a wide range of inputs effectively. A pressing concern in the evaluation process is the presence of biases in AI models, which can inadvertently surface due to the inherent biases in the human-generated data used for training. Addressing these biases and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding AI technology are formidable challenges that the AI community must actively address and mitigate.
