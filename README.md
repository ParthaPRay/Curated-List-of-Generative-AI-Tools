# Models

Large-scale language models (LLMs) are distinguished by their comprehensive language comprehension and generation abilities. These models are trained on vast data sets, learning billions of parameters, and require significant computational power for both training and operation. Typically structured as artificial neural networks, predominantly transformers, LLMs are trained through self-supervised and semi-supervised learning methods.

Functioning as autoregressive language models, LLMs process input text and iteratively predict subsequent words or tokens. Until 2020, fine-tuning was the sole approach for tailoring these models to specific tasks. However, larger models like GPT-3 have demonstrated that prompt engineering can achieve comparable results. LLMs are believed to assimilate knowledge of syntax, semantics, and "ontology" from human language data, but they also inherit any inaccuracies and biases present in these data sources.

Prominent examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series (such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 used in ChatGPT), Google's PaLM (utilized in Bard), Meta's LLaMA, along with BLOOM, Ernie 3.0 Titan, and Anthropic's Claude 2.

We present the comparative list of LLMs below. Traning cost is presented as (petaFLOP/day). For the training cost column, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP/sec Ã— 1 day = 8.64E19 FLOP.
